MarkupValidator initially made the process easier through automation surrounding XML sitemaps which made initial reporting and delivery reporting very easy. Our clients were able to see one of the many ways in which their site had improved after our work was complete. MarkupValidator team collaboration was another great step in the right direction by enabling us to place this tool directly in the hands of our developers, ensuring that they produce quality HTML even before delivery to QA or Project Management. Developers often don't have time to verify that their code is 100% valid until the development process is nearing the end. Team collaboration in MarkupValidator makes the process of creating a team and sharing your bank of checks a seamless process. I urge you to give team collaboration a try and add anyone on your team who touches HTML. You, your clients and your HTML will not regret it."</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you want to know more about MarkupValidator for teams, check this guide:</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.markupvalidator.com/collaborations-guide">https://www.markupvalidator.com/collaborations-guide</a></div><div><br></div><div>...see you next month!</div><div><br></div><div>Jaime -- MarkupValidator</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://markupvalidator.com">http://markupvalidator.com</a></div>

We've launched a complete redesign of the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com">Site Validator</a> web interface.&nbsp;We wanted to offer a simpler, faster and cleaner interface for validating sites, and we ended up with a total redesign. Follow us on a guided tour of the new interface.<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/9/redesign01_450.png"><br><br>This is a total redesign of the whole site, but the part where we've put most of the efforts on has been the sitemap list and reports. To start with, this is how the new sitemap list looks like now:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/2/half_redesign02.png"><br><br>Adding your sites is as simple as entering their main URLs and clicking a button;&nbsp;the new sitemap is added to your list, and its&nbsp;scraping and validation begins automatically.<br><br>For each one, you get its status, number of pending pages, and the errors and warnings counters for the HTML and CSS validation. If you want to re-check a whole sitemap, just click on the re-check icon.<br><br>Click on one of the sites, and you'll be shown its detailed site report:&nbsp;<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/10/redesign03_450.png"><br><br>Now, the starting view for a site report&nbsp;is the list of the URLs found in the site crawling. You can easily access the HTML or CSS summary&nbsp;reports from the tab navigation. For each page found in the site, you get its individual HTML and CSS errors and warnings counters, and a re-check button to validate again each individual web page.<br><br>You can click on any of the individual pages, or in the HTML or CSS counters, to access a detailed report of the page like this:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/5/three_quarters_redesign05.png"><br><br>For each error found, you'll be shown the line numbers&nbsp;and URL where they appear. Click on it and you'll get the HTML or CSS source of the original file, so you can easily locate each error. This feature is only available on the latest&nbsp;Chrome and Firefox browsers.<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/6/three_quarters_redesign06.png"><br><br>Coming back to the site report, you still get the HTML and CSS summary reports that group together the common errors of the site:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/7/three_quarters_redesign07.png"><br><br>Also, remember that you can use Site Validator individually or as a team. Setting up your collaborator team is as easy as sending email invitations to your team members:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/11/redesign08_450.png"><br><br>Site Validator is the #1 app for HTML and CSS validation, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com/client-testimonials">used by professional developers</a> from all around the world.<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/pricing"><b>Sign up now</b></a><b> to begin validating your sites.</b><br><br><br>

<p>Automating validations for your sites just got easier!</p>

<p>We've just released <strong>Continuous Validation</strong>, that lets you specify site-wide HTML and CSS validations on your sites to be run automatically after you deploy a new version of your site.</p>

<p>To set up automatic validations for your sites, you just need to define what validations should be run, and instruct your hosting platform to notify us via a webhook.</p>

<p>Most modern hosting platforms now include webhooks and we're documenting how to integrate many of them, like <a href="http://docs.sitevalidator.com/continuous-validation/#example-netlify">Netlify</a>, <a href="http://docs.sitevalidator.com/continuous-validation/#example-heroku">Heroku</a> or <a href="http://docs.sitevalidator.com/continuous-validation/#example-cloud-66">Cloud 66</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.sitevalidator.com/continuous-validation/">Check out the documentation</a> to get up and running in minutes.</p>

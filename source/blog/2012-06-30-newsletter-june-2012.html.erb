<b>Subscription plans!!!</b><p>Monthly subscription plans are ready, you can now have your validation credits recharged automatically every month, without the need to manually buy packs of credits.</p><p>Just visit&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3clove.com/plans-and-pricing">http://w3clove.com/plans-and-pricing</a>&nbsp;and choose the monthly plan that best suits your needs.</p><p>If you're not sure about how many page validations you need per month, you can still buy packs of 1,000 validations.</p><p>Since launch this month, we've received orders from Greece, Spain and Australia. It's great to have users from all over the World! :)</p><b>Only HTML links, please!</b><p>We've improved the scraper so it does not try to validate non-html links, like images, javascript, ftp, skype, etc.&nbsp;<br>This way we'll only try to validate the links that look validatable.</p><p>If we're still missing some case, please let us know and we'll fix it!</p><b>We're on Hacker News!</b><p>This month we had a traffic peak due to our appearance at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4120171">Hacker News</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4120171">Smashing Magazine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://html5weekly.com/archive/42.html">HTML5 Weekly</a>.</p><p>MarkupValidator is becoming very popular and our&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3clove.com/charts/errors/bar">Top 100 Markup Validation Errors</a>&nbsp;report interested many people worldwide.

Faster! Faster!</b><p>We now have an elastic background queue, that scales as needed. So, we're now using up to 10 workers simultaneously, depending on the job queue size.</p><p>What does this all mean to you? Your validations will run really faster and take seconds instead of minutes to complete.</p><p>Try it now!</p><b>Beta access to the new interface</b><p>The long-awaited graphical redesign is almost finished, and we're looking for a few beta testers.</p><p><img width="350" alt="new design" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_4_1.png"></p><p>If you want to try it out before we launch it, drop us an email at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">markupvalidator@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;and we'll give you access.</p><b>Thanks!!!</b><p>That's all for now, a big&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.markupvalidator.com/thanks">thank you</a>&nbsp;to everybody!</p><p><img width="350" alt="thanks" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_4_2.png"></p><p>See you next month!</p><p>Love and validations,&nbsp;<br>Jaime -- MarkupValidator</p>

When talking to different developers about how they use <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com">Site Validator</a> to validate their sites, we've found the need for different flows when fixing their HTML and CSS validation errors.<br><br>Until now, once you've fixed your errors and need to re-validate to ensure they've been fixed, you only had two options.<br><br>First, you could <b>re-validate your entire site</b>. This is appropiate when the changes you've made affect the whole site, like for example a change in the layout, or the stylesheets. But it can take a long time and too many credits from your account in case the changes have been made only to a small section of your site.<br><br>For those cases, you might prefer to <b>re-check pages individually</b>. This is the way to go when you've made changes only to a few of them. It's faster and cheaper, but you also need to locate the URLs to be rechecked.<br><br>Now, we've introduced a new flow, that allows you to <b>validate only the pages affected by a particular error</b>.<br><br>Let's see how this works:<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/17/three_quarters_reports04.png"><br><br>When you're on the HTML or CSS summary reports for your site, you'll see the errors and warnings grouped by their message. This is great for getting an idea of common errors along all the pages of your site.<br><br>Now, you can click on one of those errors and see how many pages are affected and, if you wish, tell Site Validator to re-check them at once, with a single click. In this example, only 46 pages where affected, so you just need to click this button to re-check them all, you don't need to re-check each of them individually, or to re-check the whole site.<br><br>If you want to see what pages are affected by a given error, you can click on the link to see a report like this one. It will also contain a Help tab with some more information about the error and a link to the Knowledge Base.<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/18/three_quarters_reports05.png"><br><br>We hope this helps you improve your validations and fixing flow, and saves you some extra time :)<br><br>Remember, if you haven't yet started validating your sites, you can try our service with our 30-days money-back guarantee.&nbsp;<b><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/pricing">Start here</a></b>.

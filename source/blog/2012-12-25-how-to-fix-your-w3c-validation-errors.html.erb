<div>While most of the users of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com">Site Validator</a>&nbsp;are web professionals, freelancers and web studios, there are also many other users that come to our site in search for a fix for their HTML and CSS validation errors.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most frequent questions about our service is then, how do I fix my site? Or even, does Site Validator fix my errors?<br><br>The short answer is no, we don't fix your errors, you have to do it yourself or hire a web developer for that task.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What does Site Validator do for you?</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our service helps you validate HTML and CSS markup on your entire website. It's a much faster alternative than doing it through the official W3C validator: using this one you would need to manually submit each of the URLs on your site, once on the HTML validator and one on the CSS validator.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, our Site Validator service does all these validations for you. If you have a site with 250 internal pages, our service will do 500 validations for you (250 HTML validations and 250 CSS validations).</div><div><br></div><div>That's what service is about, a fast validation system for your whole site. We don't offer the service of fixing errors, this is a job that has to be done manually by a web developer.</div><div><br></div><div><b>So, how do I fix my markup errors?</b></div><div><br></div><div>If you are not an expert on web development, your best option is hiring a professional for that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are specialized sites where you can find a web developer, for instance oDesk:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.odesk.com/o/profiles/browse/c/web-development/">https://www.odesk.com/o/profiles/browse/c/web-development/</a></div><div><br></div><div>I would look for a professional there and ensure he/she has the skills to fix W3C validation errors, and also that he knows the current system you're using to publish your web site. For example, if your site is generated with Wordpress, I would search for the skills "wordpress w3c", like this:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.odesk.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=wordpress+w3c">https://www.odesk.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=wordpress+w3c</a></div><div><br></div><div>Then you can have a look at their profiles and reputation, to find the one that best suits your needs and budget. I wouldn't go with the cheapest developers, though.</div><div><br></div><div>Apart from oDesk, there are other sites where you can find a good developer, like:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://elance.com">http://elance.com</a></div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freelance.com">http://freelance.com</a></div><div><br></div><div>If you prefer to fix the errors yourself, you can get some help on the Site Validator forum. You can search your validation errors and learn how to fix them. If your error hasn't a fix listed, you can ask for help to other developers on the community by leaving a message through the comments form.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://forum.sitevalidator.com">http://forum.sitevalidator.com</a><br><br><br></div>

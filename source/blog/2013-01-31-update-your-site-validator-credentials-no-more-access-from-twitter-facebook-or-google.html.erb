title: "Update your Site Validator credentials: no more access from Twitter, Facebook or Google"
tags: accounts

<div>When we started with Site Validator, we allowed users to authenticate using their Twitter, Facebook or Google accounts instead of creating a new user account on our app.</div><div><br></div><div>Although this provided a quick start, in the long term we have seen some of its disadvantages:<br><br></div><ul><li>Some users didn't feel comfortable with us having access to their Twitter / Facebook / Google accounts. Although we only ask for authentication permissions, and never for writing permissions (that is, we can't tweet using your account), it made some people feel uneasy - they prefer to isolate their accounts.</li><li>Offering 3 kinds of authentication seemed very flexible, but in fact it was too flexible. Some people logged in using their Twitter account and days later came back to the site but didn't remember if they had accessed using Twitter, Facebook or Google. This led to unnecessary duplication of accounts.</li><li>People using our tool from within a company would prefer to use their identity on that company, instead of their personal identity on a social network. This usually translates into logging in using their work email, instead of their personal Twitter nickname.</li><li>In cases where we need to contact our users, an email is a much more reliable way than a Twitter / Facebook / Google access token.</li><li>Depending on a 3rd party to authenticate means that when this 3rd party is down, users cannot log in. This doesn't happen too often, but it does happen. You know, the typical "Twitter / Facebook&nbsp;is down, so I can't log in my other apps", and the easiest way to avoid it is not depending on 3rd parties.</li></ul><div><br>So, later on we introduced the ability to create proper Site Validator accounts with your email and password. Since then, most users have preferred that to authenticating via an external provider.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Now, in an effort to simplify the access to our application, we're asking our users to set up their Site Validator credentials, and deprecating the access from the external providers. When you log in, you'll be prompted to go to the Edit Account section to enter your email and password.</div><div><br></div><div>We hope this change is for best and simplifies things for everyone.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll still support the old accesses for some time, but will be totally removed on the following months.</div>

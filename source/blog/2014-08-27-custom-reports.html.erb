<div>Do you know what's cooler than being able to validate HTML and CSS on your sites with a single click?<br><br></div><div>Being able to validate just HTML, or just CSS, if you wish.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Enter custom reports</b></div><div><br></div><div>Today we've launched a new version of Site Validator that puts you in control of the kind of validations you wish to perform on your sites. You'll also be able to set the maximum number of pages you want to validate, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 2,000 pages.</div><div><br></div><div>To start a site validation you just need to enter the starting URL and set the desired options. As you change them, we'll give you an estimation of the time and cost needed to perform it. When you're happy to begin, just click "Start validation".</div><div><br></div><div>The interface has been simplified, now it's easier to see the progress of the validation and the results. You don't need to wait as you'll be notified by email when the validation is finished, but it's nice to watch it while it does the hard work for you anyway :D</div><div><br></div><div>You can also re-check individual pages, so you don't need to validate the entire site again and again if you just fixed some of the pages.<br><br>Check it out on this short video:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://sitevalidator.wistia.com/medias/tsnw0okrs0"><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/20/video_home.jpg"></a><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>So, should I validate CSS for my entire site?</b></div><div><br></div><div>You may be wondering, why is CSS validation turned off by default now? The answer is that, in most cases, you don't really need to validate CSS for all the pages in your site. If you follow the web design best practices, you'll put all your CSS styles in external stylesheets and avoid using inline styles in your pages. This way you're getting a better organized site, and also helps with the performance as the stylesheets will be cached by the browser.</div><div><br></div><div>If you validate CSS for every page in your site it will take much longer to validate the site, as the W3C CSS validation software will need to validate your external stylesheets linked to every single page. And, you'll be notified of the same CSS errors for every page that uses these styles.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, when you're using third party styles like for example those in the Twitter Bootstrap framework, it can be nearly impossible to achieve 100% valid CSS.</div><div><br></div><div>So, our recommendation is: when site-wide validating, check the HTML syntax for every page in your site (as they're all different), but validate CSS separately (using the W3C CSS validator directly if you only have one stylesheet, or validating a sitemap linking to the different stylesheets if you have many).</div><div><br></div><div><b>How many pages should I validate?</b><br></div><div><br></div><div>When we launched Site Validator, you could validate up to 100 pages per sitemap. Later we increased it to 250 pages, and now we've set the limit to 2,000 pages per sitemap.</div><div><br></div><div>But does that mean you should validate always two thousand pages on your site?<br><br>Absolutely not.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's imagine you're in charge of developing the new version of a popular site like NBC.com. According to Google, this site has <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.es/search?q=site%3A+www.nbc.com">more than 63 million web pages</a>. Should you try to validate 63 million pages, really? Nonsense.</div><div><br></div><div>What you'd do instead is prepare a sitemap with a selection of pages from the different sections, and validate only those. If you have a template for a kind of page, you only need to validate it once, not the hundreds of thousands of pages that might be using this template.</div><div><br></div><div>That's why you're free now to validate up to 2,000 pages per sitemap, but you can also specify a much lower limit, for example validating 25 pages might be enough in most cases. It depends on your site.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Double credits!</b></div><div><br></div><div>Now that you're able to specify how many validations you want to make, you'll be charged separately for HTML and CSS validations. For example, if you validate just HTML you'll spend one credit per each validated page; if you validate HTML and CSS, you'll spend two credits per each validated page.</div><div><br></div><div>We're also doubling the number of credits you get with your subscription, for example the Freelancer subscription that had 5,000 credits per month, now has been increased to 10,000 credits per month. So you'll be able to keep validating HTML and CSS on your sites for the same price, or validate the double amount of pages if you only validate HTML.</div><div><br></div><div>We hope these improvements help you create amazing, more valid, web sites! Let us know how it goes for you.</div><div><br></div><div>If you haven't yet tried Site Validator, what are you waiting for? Remember there's a 30-days money back guarantee for all our subscription plans!</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/pricing">Start validating your sites now</a>.</div><div><br><b>UPDATE September 3rd</b>: we've increased the maximum number of pages per sitemap to 2,000 pages. Happy validating!</div><div><br></div>

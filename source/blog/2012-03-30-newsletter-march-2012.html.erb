<b>Powered by you</b><p>W3Clove is a personal project maintained by&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jaimeiniesta.com/">Jaime Iniesta</a>&nbsp;(that's me!). I'm trying to keep the costs at a minimum, but as the platform grows and helps validate more sites (376,285 pages now), the hosting costs also grow.</p><p>I don't like the idea of placing ads on the site, so I've been working with&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://majesticseacreature.com/">Gregory Brown</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mendicantuniversity.org/">Mendicant University</a>&nbsp;to find an alternative way of making this service sustainable over time.</p><p>You can read more about this important change at the '<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/articles/w3clove-is-now-charity-driven">W3Clove is now charity driven</a>' and '<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/articles/w3clove-beyond-charity">W3Clove: beyond charity</a>' posts, but the rough numbers are: after 10 months of existence, W3Clove has earned $351 and has spent $335, so all that remains now is $15. The monthly hosting costs are about $70/month so we need some more help from the users!</p><b>We've got an API</b><p>I've been working on adding an API to W3Clove, that will let other developers use it as a platform to create applications on top of it. You can read more about it at the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3clove.com/rest_api_reference">W3Clove REST API reference page</a>. Basically, it allows you to submit sitemaps, as well as individual pages, for validation and get the results in JSON format.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://steveklabnik.com/">Steve Klabnik</a>&nbsp;is being a great help here, guiding me on the process of designing an Hypermedia API.</p><p>If you build something on top of this API, please let me know so I can feature it on the site.</p><b>W3Clove FIGHT!</b><p>Built as an example of how to use the API,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://fight.w3clove.com/">W3Clove FIGHT!</a>&nbsp;is a game where you can make two sites of your choice 'fight' for markup validation supremacy. The one with fewer errors wins. :)</p><p><img width="350" alt="FIGHT" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_1_1.png"></p><b>A brand new design is coming!</b><p>My friend Luis Herrero is making his particular donation to the W3Clove project by means of a complete graphical redesign of the site, that will make it much more usable, and will adapt to different display resolutions and devices thanks to its responsive design techniques. Luis is an awesome front-end developer with a lot of experience on HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, and a great team player.</p><p><img width="350" alt="New design" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_1_2.png"></p><p></p><p>...and that's all for this month, W3C lovers!</p><p>See you next month!&nbsp;<br>Jaime Iniesta -- W3Clove</p>

If you've been with us since the beginning of our project, you may remember the days when this project was called <b>W3Clove</b>. Yeah, this was the very beginning of a project that started as a Ruby gem and back then, it was a good, fun name to begin with.<br><br>Maybe too fun, as some people misread it as "W3 Clove", so we later rebranded ourselves as <b>W3CLove</b>, with a capital "L". What we wanted to express with that name was our love for the W3C standards.<br><br>But after some time, we thought that some people would incorrectly think that our project was an official tool of the W3C. And now, as it says on the footer of every page on our site, we're an indepent site validator, not affiliated in any way with the W3C.<br><br>So, to make it clearer, we decided to change our name. We wanted to change to a simple name: "Site Validator". Oh, but the domain was already taken (by someone who was not using it). It was about to expire, so we waited for its availability. In the meantime, as we wanted to state as clearly as possible our independence, we chose a temporary brand: <b>MarkupValidator</b>.<br><br>And finally, a few months later, we acquired the domain name that we were waiting for, so we're now <b>Site Validator</b>,&nbsp;you can find us now at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com">http://sitevalidator.com</a>, &nbsp;follow us on our Twitter account <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/SiteValidator">@SiteValidator</a>, and contact us at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank">support@sitevalidator.com</a><br><br>That's our last rename, we promise!<br><br>Thanks for your patience :)<br><br><br>

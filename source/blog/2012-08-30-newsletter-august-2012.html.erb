<b>Deep link crawling</b><p>We've improved the web crawling process to discover and validate deep nested pages in your sites. Now, the MarkupValidator spider will crawl your site to find up to a maximum of 250 pages, and validate them all.</p><p>Say, for example, that you submit your home page URL, and the blog is linked from there. Our spider will find the blog, and also find each post, the archives, etc.</p><p>You can still use an XML sitemap if you prefer to specify the exact URLs that you want to validate. This will be faster as well, as less crawling will be needed.</p><b>How to validate your local server or local files</b><p>Ever wanted to validate a site that hasn't still been deployed to production?

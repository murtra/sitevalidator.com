<div><b>CSS Validations are here!</b><br><br></div><div>We've added a new feature to MarkupValidator that will let you validate CSS stylesheets for your entire sites, with just one click.</div><div><br></div><div>It works just like the HTML site-wide validation that you're used to in MarkupValidator. No extra steps needed, just enter the URL of your site and we'll get its internal pages and validate CSS (and HTML) for all of them.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll get a detailed report for the CSS errors found on every page, as well as a summary report for the grouped CSS errors. Clicking on any of these errors will let you know where the error has been found - be it on an HTML page, or on an external stylesheet.</div><div><br></div><div>Check out this sample report to get an idea of what the new HTML and CSS site-wide validations are like:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.markupvalidator.com/sitemaps/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvalidationhell.com">https://www.markupvalidator.com/sitemaps/check?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvalidationhell.com</a></div><div><br></div><div>CSS errors reports have also been included on the CSV exports that you get when you download the reports to your computer.</div><div><br></div><div>All subscription plans have now access to this new feature, for the new validations that you make from now on. To include CSS validations on your existing reports, you just need to click the "Recheck now" button.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How to install the W3C CSS Validator on your own server</b><br><br></div><div>One of the things that we needed for our new CSS validation feature was installing the W3C CSS Validator software on our own dedicated server. This allows us to do as many validations as we need, without sending any traffic to the W3C.</div><div><br></div><div>As the official documentation was a bit outdated, we sponsored the creation of updated documentation about installing the validator on your own server. And we've released it with a Creative Commons license, so everyone can benefit from this new step-by-step guide.</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tlvince/w3c-validator-guide">https://github.com/tlvince/w3c-validator-guide</a></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tlvince/w3c-css-validator-guide">https://github.com/tlvince/w3c-css-validator-guide</a></div><div><br></div><div>Both guides have been carefully crafted by the awesome Tom Vincent. Check out his blog and follow him on Twitter, he's a great hacker and a gentleman.</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tlvince.com">http://tlvince.com</a></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tlvince">https://twitter.com/tlvince</a></div><div><br></div><div><b>Site Validator gem</b><br><br></div><div>Did you know that there is an open source, stand-alone version of MarkupValidator that you can run from your own computer? Well, although it's not as feature-complete as our web service, it's still a great tool:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/site_validator">https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/site_validator</a></div><div><br></div><div>You can also follow updates about this ruby gem on the @SiteValidator Twitter account:</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/sitevalidator">https://twitter.com/sitevalidator</a></div><div><br></div><div>...and that's all for this month, see you on December!</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Jaime -- MarkupValidator</div>

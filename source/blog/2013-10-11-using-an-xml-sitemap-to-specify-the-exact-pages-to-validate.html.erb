We work hard to provide you with the simplest tool to validate HTML and CSS on your&nbsp;sites. That's why all that is needed to validate a site is entering its main URL, and we'll take care of crawling it to discover its internal links.<br><br>That's the simplest way and&nbsp;the most efficient use of your time, but sometimes you need more control over the exact pages you want to validate on your site. For example, the crawler might get too deep on a large&nbsp;section of your site and ignore others. Or it might get trapped crawling similar pages (think of a calendar widget, a large pagination, or a large tag set). As we currently have a limit of 250 pages per sitemap, this can result in some sections of your large sites not being validated.<br><br>Also, thinking about speed, crawling a site can be very time consuming. Basically, what the crawler does is visiting every page found and following the internal links,&nbsp;searching for more undiscovered pages. This can take a long time, but if you had a way to tell Site Validator the exact pages you want to validate, this crawling would not be needed.<br><br>So, what's the solution to both of these problems? XML sitemaps!<br><br>An XML sitemap is a simple text file that contains information about the URLs on a site. You can learn about how to produce an XML sitemap at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html">http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html</a>&nbsp;and there are also good tools to write it for you like&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">http://www.xml-sitemaps.com/</a>, and even plugins for popular web platforms like&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/</a>&nbsp;<br><br>In the end, what you'll have is an XML file containing the URLs that you want to validate on your site. You just need to pass Site Validator this URL and it will get the links from there, with no need to crawl your site. This way you specify the exact URLs to validate and it's much faster.<br><br>Another use of XML sitemaps is having different reports for different sections of your site. You could have an XML sitemap for the blog, other for the shop, other for the FAQs section, you get the idea.<br><br>Please note that Site Validator processes basic XML sitemaps only: we don't process neither&nbsp;compressed sitemaps, nor nested sitemaps.<br><br>Also, the crawling will still take place if the XML sitemap contains less than 250 URLs. What the XML sitemap provides are the starting URLs only, we'll crawl them to get to the 250 limit if needed.<br><br><br>

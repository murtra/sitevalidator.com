<b>No more cloves</b><p>Some people found the app name confusing, reading it as 'W3 Clove' instead of the intended 'W3C love'.</p><p>So, to avoid confusion, I've changed slightly the name to MarkupValidator. I hope it's more readable this way.</p><b>Developer portal and forum</b><p>I've setup a new site for the API documentation at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://developer.w3clove.com/">http://developer.w3clove.com</a>, which includes a link to a forum and an issue tracker.</p><p>Check them out if you're a developer interested in using MarkupValidator as a platform.</p><p>BTW, I've released the code for this documentation site as an open source template that you can use to document your own APIs:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/developer.w3clove.com">https://github.com/jaimeiniesta/developer.w3clove.com</a></p><p><img width="350" alt="developer portal" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_2_1.png"></p><b>Steve Klabnik's "Designing Hypermedia APIs"</b><p>Steve Klabnik is writing a book about about Hypermedia APIs, and he's also giving talks about Ruby conferences worldwide.</p><p>And he's using MarkupValidator as an example of the process of designing an API. You'll find the links at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://developer.w3clove.com/api/references">http://developer.w3clove.com/api/references</a></p><p><img width="350" alt="Steve Klabnik" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_2_2.png"></p><b>Top 100 Errors and Warnings</b><p>After 5 months, MarkupValidator has helped validate more than 400,000 pages, and it has collected all of their errors and warnings. I've setup a report of the top 100 errors and warnings and a nice pie chart, here&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3clove.com/charts/errors">http://w3clove.com/charts/errors</a></p><p><img width="350" alt="top 100 errors and warnings" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_2_3.png"></p><b>Financial status</b><p>I've run out of funds and I need your help to pay for the hosting fees!</p><p>MarkupValidator needs an average of $35/month to be sustainable; some users have already donated through the Pledgie campaign, but we need more help to keep the app working for the next months.</p><p>If you find MarkupValidator useful, please donate through&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://w3clove.com/donate">http://w3clove.com/donate</a></p><p>...and that's all for this month, W3C Lovers!</p><p>See you next month :)&nbsp;<br>Jaime -- MarkupValidator</p>

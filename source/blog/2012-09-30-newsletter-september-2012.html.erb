<b>New feature: Team Collaborations</b><p>Whether you run a company or work as a freelancer for several clients, MarkupValidator for teams is for you.</p><p>With MarkupValidator for teams, managers can create a centralized account for their company, and invite their employees to join it, so everyone can work collaboratively sharing the same sitemaps list. Only the company account needs to subscribe to a plan; collaborator accounts are free and benefit from the credits on the company account.</p><p>Managers can easily control which users are on the team, and track the credit expense for every collaborator.</p><p>Collaborators can work for different clients if they wish, jumping from one account to another with a single click.</p><p>See how easy it is to set up a team:</p><p>Once the manager has signed up and subscribed to a Studio plan (5 collaborators) or Enterprise plan (50 collaborators), it's as easy as going to the team management page and sending an email invitation to each collaborator.</p><img alt="Team management" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_7_1.png"><p></p><p>Each colllaborator will then receive an email invitation to join the team. They just need to follow the link there to accept or reject it.</p><img alt="Collaboration invitation" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_7_2.png"><p></p><p>When a collaborator is working on a team, she can validate sites using the team's credits, and access the team's sitemaps list.</p><img alt="Collaboration working for a team" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_7_3.png"><p></p><p>The team's manager can easily see how many credits has each collaborator spent, and also has access to a detailed record of every single validation made from her credits log.</p><img alt="Manager tracking credits" src="http://sitevalidator.com/images/news_7_4.png"><p></p><p>That's how easy it is to get all your developers validating entire sites together.</p><p>Sign up now for a Studio (5 collaborators, 24 $/month) or Enterprise (50 collaborators, 48 $/month) account:</p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3clove.com/users/sign_up">https://www.w3clove.com/users/sign_up</a></p><b>How to fix the Top 100 Errors</b><p>One of the most popular pages of MarkupValidator is probably the Top 100 Errors list, which shows the most common markup validation errors found.</p><p>Now, thanks to the awesome Lewis Howles, we have a detailed explanation and fix for each of them.

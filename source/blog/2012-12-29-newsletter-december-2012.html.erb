<div><b>There goes 2012!</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Phew, this has been an exciting and exhausting year! Let's review what happened during 2012:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In May</b>, we passed from the initial charity-driven beta phase to a finished paid product that let web developers like you validate sites for HTML errors with a single click. Organizations like the Web Australian Awards used our tool extensively and we started with our paid plans.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In June</b>, we launched our monthly subscription plans, increased the number or pages per sitemap, and worked on an elastic background queue to help accomodate all the requests from our users, that grew suddenly after appearing in Hacker News.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In July</b>, we opened access to our new interface, added proper user accounts to be able to log in with your email and password, moved the validation software to a dedicated server, and added HTTPS security to our whole application, including the API.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In August</b>, we launched our deep-link crawling feature, which allows you to get more validated pages on your site, automatically. The free trials period ended, so the application was reserved to paid users only, and we offered a 30-days money-back guarantee for everyone.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In September</b>, our much requested Team Collaborations feature was launched. This allows Web Studios to have a centralized account for all web developers on the team.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In October</b>, we renamed our application to MarkupValidator, to use a brand easier to pronounce and also make clear that we're an independent project.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>In November</b>, we added CSS validations for all the users. So now, every page processed with our tool is validated for HTML and CSS errors, at the same price.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In short, 2012 has been an amazing year, but what has been most amazing is getting in contact with web developers like you, from so many different countries in the World.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you all, and let's keep caring for our markup correctness on the following years!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>From our blog:</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We have launched the official MarkupValidator blog, and you can subscribe with your RSS reader or by email.

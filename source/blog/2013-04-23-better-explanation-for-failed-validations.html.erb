When a site is submitted for markup validation on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sitevalidator.com/">Site Validator</a>&nbsp;the initial URL is scraped in search for internal links, and then each of them is deep scraped in search for more internal pages to validate.<br><br>This URL discovery process often results in finding pages that can't be processed, typically due to some of these reasons:<br><br><ul><li><b>Not Found</b>. Sometimes, there's a broken link and the URL simply does not exist.</li><li><b>Authorization Required</b>. Only public pages can be validated. If you need to validate private pages, read <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://docs.sitevalidator.com/validating-your-local-server/">this guide about validating a local server</a>.</li><li><b>Server Error</b>. The visited page returns a server error message.</li><li><b>Redirections</b>. While Site Validator can handle most of the page redirections, there are cases where they aren't accepted, like redirections to an URL outside the scope of the initial URL.</li></ul>In order to provide more information about these failed validations, we're now storing the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">response status codes</a> from the pages, and showing it when needed. For example, take a look at this <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://app.sitevalidator.com/s/cbf35b792a90aa46958f83ca015a08cbe5f72ae9/u">sample validation report</a> to see an error message about a "404 Not Found".<br><br><img alt="" src="https://sitevalidator.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/image_asset/storage/12/site_validator_404.png"><br><br>For each failed page, we're showing its response status code, and the referrer URL from where it was linked.<br><br>We hope this gives you more information about the status of your site and helps you find and fix some broken links.<br><br><br>
